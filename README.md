This is a React app that explores building out the frontend components for a random quote generator. The user can update the page with new quotes and choose to tweet the quote as well.

Check out the demo <a href="https://plumsily.github.io/random-quote-machine/">here</a>!

Inspired from a FreeCodeCamp project found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine.
